    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "FBA, or Flux Balance Analysis is a metabolic modelling method widely used to build genome scale metabolic models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its first significant use was in a paper from David Fell in 1986 (https://doi.org/10.1042/bj2380781), where it was used to model fat synthesis in adipose tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique was championed by Bernard Palsson, who has published many genome scale metabolic models, and improvements and extensions of the method over the past two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used it in my PhD, in my postdoc with Gavin Thomas, and more recently as part of Gavin's MORF project."

    "## Quick summary of FBA\n",
    "\n",
    "A model comprises, broadly, of a set of reactions with associated genes and metabolites in one or more \"compartments\" (more detail on that later...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reactions are represented as a set of balanced equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of balanced equations are solved using linear programming."

   },
   "source": [
    "## Important terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Each reaction has constraints applied, i.e. upper and lower bounds for the reaction's flux, which limits the solution space which has to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often FBA is referred to as constraint-based modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "These constraints define the reversibility of the reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "An objective function is defined and optimised, given the set of equations and their constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually this objective function is to maximise biomass production, but it could also be another function of the network, or it could be minimised. Multiple objective functions are possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biomass reaction stoichiometry should be measured experimentally!"

    "## Important terms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compartments\n",
    "\n",
    "A model can have one or more compartments, between which metabolites can move via so-called exchange reactions (transport). Metabolites belong to one compartment, so exchange reactions between compartments have separate metabolites for each compartment on each side of the exchange reaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "These compartments are analagous to compartments within cells, e.g. extracellular space, periplasm, cytoplasm, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uptakes and effluxes (AKA exchange reactions)\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange reactions that allow metabolites to enter and leave the model are called uptake and efflux reactions respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an uptake reaction would be glucose entering a model of _E. coli_ as a carbon source, and an example of an efflux reaction could be acetate leaving the model as a by-product.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are one-sided reactions."

    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions are an important part of any model!\n",
    "\n",
    "One important assumption is that any model is incomplete, because you don't have perfect knowledge of its genes, proteins, and metabolic reactions. The extent of this incompleteness will vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "By its nature, FBA assumes that the system is at steady state, i.e. that overall production equals consumption, although there are some hacky ways round this.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining FBA models with experimental data, experimental measurements are usually taken during log phase when growth rate is roughly linear or at pseudo steady state.\n",
    "\n",
    "FBA takes no account of differing reaction kinetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of flux in FBA models are mmol/gram dry weight/hour."
